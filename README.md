#go-pher
This is an implementation of the gopher protocol for go.  It provides an interface for serving and retrieving gopher pages.  main.go implements a server using this package and cmain.go is a client.
##TODOs
* decoding of encoded data (uuencode, etc)
* URL selectors maybe?
* parsing of gopher:// links
